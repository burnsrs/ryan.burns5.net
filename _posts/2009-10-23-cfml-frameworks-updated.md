summary: Updated the eclipse plugin to include additional frameworks

So last night I updated the plugin to now include skeletons for FW/1 and LightFront, lightweight frameworks developed by Sean Corfield and Brian Meloche respectively. I also have modified the update site so updates should now work correctly. So now the plugin provides skeleton applications for the following frameworks: ColdBox FuseBox -Non XML -Tradition / XML FW/1 LightFront Mach-II Model-Glue The update site to add into Eclipse is as follows: http://www.robertburns.me/update/
