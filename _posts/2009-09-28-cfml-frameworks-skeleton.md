As an avid CFEclipse user I have always been interested in the inner workings of an Eclipse plugin and decided to throw my hat into the ring.  I have created a CFML Frameworks Skeleton plugin.  It allows you to create a new project within Eclipse based upon the skeleton applications for the various frameworks.  So far I have added the skeleton applications from the following frameworks: ColdBox FuseBox -Non XML -Tradition / XML Mach-II Model-Glue The update site to add into Eclipse is as follows: http://www.robertburns.me/update/ If you don't mind, give it a shot and let me know if it is valuable plugin for the CFML community.
