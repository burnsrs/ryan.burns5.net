summary: Updated the eclipse plugin to include additional frameworks

So last night I updated the plugin to now include skeletons for FW/1 and LightFront, lightweight frameworks developed by Sean Corfield and Brian Meloche respectively. I also have modified the update site so updates should now work correctly.
